# Stat Grabber

## TODO
- Stop manually moving data over to my structs, just store the data as is and sort the teams later
  - Change field names to snake case and use the serde_json macro that looks for camel case
- Finish/test game validation
- Grab 100 of each type of game rather than 100 games total
- Ensure the list of games is time sorted
